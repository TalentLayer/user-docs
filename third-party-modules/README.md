Third-party modules are integrations with other composable protocols or dev tools that enhance the value prop of platforms building on TalentLayer. These modules were built by TalentLayer Labs and are fully open-source and available for anyone to use in their platforms.

{% hint style="success" %}
All TalentLayer third-party modules are housed in separate folders in the TalentLayer Indie demo dapp, and can easily be added to platforms by copying the folder into your repo.&#x20;
