## Higher Liquidity Means Increased User Loyalty

Right now, users of freelance platforms and talent pools resort to maintaining duplicative accounts across many platforms because they can’t find sufficient counter-parties on just one platform. This is the crux of the “chicken and egg” problem in marketplaces.

{% hint style="info" %}
👩🏽 **User Story:** Mei Ling is a freelance Javascript engineer in France. She uses Upwork, Toptal, and a freelance marketplace that serves France, to find work. She maintains user accounts and reputations on each platform because if she just used one, she wouldn’t be able to find enough gigs to sustain her career.

👨🏻 **User Story:** Yusef is a ride share driver in Miami. He uses both Uber and Lyft every day when working. He keeps both apps open at once because finding riders on just one app doesn’t give him enough riders to make the pay worth his hours invested.
{% endhint %}

If you speak to any gig worker, this type of situation is not an outlier; **it’s the norm**. Even the biggest labor marketplaces have strong liquidity issues.

Using multiple platforms means:

* Users deal with more friction when it comes to maintaining accounts and finding work
* Users are forced to use multiple platforms, when they’d rather use just one

**Bringing higher liquidity of users and gigs to your platform means users will stay because they don’t NEED to move. This leads to improved user experience, more revenues, and increased user loyalty for your platform.**

## Higher Liquidity Means More Work Being Done

Through increasing liquidity of users and gigs on your platform, you reduce friction in the hiring process; this friction today impacts the amount of labor and funds that can be exchanged between counter-parties. With higher liquidity, more work can be done on your platform; this in turn leads to more revenues for you and your team.

We can all benefit from more efficiency in labor markets - imaging the human potential waiting to be unlocked!

📚 **Cross-Industry Case Study: I**n decentralized finance or “defi”, platforms generally interface with one backend for liquidity; for example, thousands of frontends leverage Uniswap’s smart contracts and liquidity pools. This enables them to conduct transactions in quantities unheard of in traditional finance, with dramatically less friction. The same is now possible in labor markets thanks to TalentLayer.
