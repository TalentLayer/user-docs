## Understanding TalentLayer Core's Components <a href="#understanding-talentlayer-cores-components" id="understanding-talentlayer-cores-components"></a>

TalentLayer Core is composed of the following key modules:

* **TalentLayerID:** Worker and hirer identity
* **TalentLayerPlatformID:** Marketplace configuration (fees, dispute, access)
* **TalentLayerReview:** Mutual review&#x20;
* **TalentLayerService:** Universal Services & Proposal System
* **TalentLayerEscrow:** Escrow & Dispute System

TalentLayer creates a paradigm shift in how freelance marketplaces operate by creating a pool of jobs and user reputations that any marketplace can tap into. Users maintain one self-owned reputation across many marketplaces. Marketplaces that build on TalentLayer can configure fees on transactions, job posts, user account creation and more - fully configurable to meet your business needs.&#x20;
