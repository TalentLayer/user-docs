## Capabilities

TalentLayer Escrow is a highly flexible escrow contract that allows you to, via your platform's user interface, allow users to conduct payments including:&#x20;

* Partial release of escrow to the counter-party by the employer.&#x20;
* Milestone-based projects, where based on the delivery of certain sub-services, an employee can receive payments.
* Periodical payment of hourly work; for example, weekly pay for hours worked.

Escrow contracts can not currently be refilled after the full amount has been released. After the full amount has been released, the service will automatically be marked complete and prompt the users to leave a review. Future transactions will have to be completed in a subsequent service.

It is possible for a freelancer to voluntarily opt-out of a service and be compensated partially for work completed, with the employer receiving the remaining amount of escrow back to their own wallet.

## TalentLayer Escrow With or Without Disputes

At the platform level, you can decide whether to allow your users to initiate disputes or not. If you choose to allow for disputes, you must choose which type of arbitration to support.&#x20;
