## Is TalentLayer A Good Fit For Your Platform? <a href="#is-talentlayer-a-good-fit-for-your-platform" id="is-talentlayer-a-good-fit-for-your-platform"></a>

Are you looking to build platform like freelance marketplaces, bounty platforms, hackathon platforms, gig marketplaces, or something similar? TalentLayer is optimized for a broad range of two-sided “labor platforms”, software platforms where users can complete services in exchange for payment. These platforms usually have a few things in common:

1. Hirers post tasks or other service engagements to the platform
2. Users complete work in exchange for payment
3. By completing work on the platform, users can build a reputation

TalentLayer’s modular tools can be applied to build diverse service marketplaces including…

* gig marketplaces
* ride sharing apps
* house sharing apps
* photography marketplaces
* telemedicine apps
* Rappi-style multi marketplace apps
